# NSAP-Scheme-Eligibility-Predictor

This project was completed as part of the **AICTE Virtual Internship** in collaboration with **Edunet Foundation** and **IBM Cloud**, under the theme:  
**“NSAP-Scheme-Eligibility-Predictor”** — a real-world social challenge focused on data-driven policy insights.


# 🌐 NSAP Scheme Eligibility Predictor (No-Code ML using IBM Watsonx.ai)

This is a simple and smart project where I built a machine learning model without writing any code — using **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio**.

It helps predict which **NSAP pension scheme** (Old Age, Widow, Disability) a person is eligible for, based on their age, gender, income, and other details.

## 🧐 What is this about?

NSAP is a government welfare scheme for old people, widows, and persons with disabilities living under the poverty line.  
But verifying and assigning the right scheme manually takes time and sometimes results in mistakes.

This project makes it **automatic** — using **AI**.

## ⚙️ How it works (in simple steps):

1. I collected the dataset from [AI Kosh](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in) – real applicant data from different states.
2. Uploaded the CSV file to **IBM Watsonx.ai Studio**.
3. Used **AutoAI** (a no-code tool) to train a model.
4. The system selected **Random Forest** as the best algorithm.
5. The model was deployed — so now we can give it new data and it will tell us the correct NSAP scheme.
6. Tested the model with real inputs — and it worked well 🎉

## 📦 What's inside

- Dataset file (CSV)
- Sample images of prediction results
- Deployed model using IBM Cloud (Watsonx.ai Studio)

---

## ✅ What it predicts

- **IGNOAPS** – Old Age Pension  
- **IGNWPS** – Widow Pension  
- **IGNDPS** – Disability Pension

Just give details like age, marital status, gender, income — and it will predict the correct scheme.

## 💡 Future Plans

- Make a simple app or website version  
- Add support for regional languages  
- Include more schemes  
- Link with real-time government data
